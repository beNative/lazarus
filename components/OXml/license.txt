License FAQ:

1.) Can I use OXml in commercial applications without purchasing a commercial license?

  Yes, you can. But as stated in CPAL, you have to display the Original Developer’s
  Attribution Information each time an Executable or Source Code or a Larger Work
  is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session).

  You can find the text of the required attribution text in the file 
  "OXml license CPAL 1.0.html" in EXHIBIT B.

  If this is not an alternative for you, you can purchase a full commercial license
  from http://www.kluug.net that allows you to use OXml without any attribution.


2.) Can I use OXml in freeware applications without purchasing a commercial license?

  Yes, you can. But you have to attribute OXml in the same way as described in 1.).


3.) If I buy an OXml license, how long is the commercial license valid?

  The commercial license is perpetual for OXml source code that has been released
  within a year after your purchase.

  If you want to update to OXml source code that has been released after 1 year
  of your purchase, you have to obtain a new license (with a 60% discount).
