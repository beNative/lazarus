Please see the "license/license.txt" file for more information
about OXml licensing.

Every file of the OXml library is subject of the "license/license.txt" 
text.

There is an exception: files in "units/OmniXML" and "units/KOmniXML"
are supplied with a different licensing model (please see the 
License.txt file in each directory).
Furthermore the demos (in "demos/" directory) are public domain.
