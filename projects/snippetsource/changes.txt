Welcome to SnippetSource. A new SQLite database will be created.

SnippetSource lets you organise your favorite pieces of code, scripts, thoughts,
notes or other documents in a user definable tree structure.

Tips and tricks, solutions to problems you encounter and references can be
organised as you like.

You can accompany your node with formatted text in RTF format, which will be
stored together with the node.

All data is stored in a simple yet powerful SQLite database which provides you
with immediate access to your stored ideas.

Create new folders and documents. You can drag and drop one or multiple files
into the treeview to create them as snippets in SnippetSource.

This will create a copy of each document and will recreate the underlying folder
structure as wel.

Nodes can be moved by dragging them to another folder.

It shares the text editor with my Notepas project.

Since version 3 the possibility to execute script code was added. Snippets that
represent script code can directly be executed.

Another new feature is you can now customize the node images from a user
definable set of glyphs which can be stored in the snippet database.

As I developer I use it for storing SQL-scripts, code snippets and short
tutorials with solutions for common problems.

The source to your snippets of your sources

The abillity to execute scripts was added.

IDEAS:
- support for multiple databases as tabbed views
- drag and drop of nodes between seperate instances of snippetsource
