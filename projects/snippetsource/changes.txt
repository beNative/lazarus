SnippetSource lets you organise your favorite pieces of code, scripts, thoughts,
notes or other documents in a user definable tree structure.

Tips and tricks, solutions to problems you encounter and references can be
organised as you like.

You can accompany your node with formatted text in RTF format, which will be
stored together with the node. It also supports embedded images that you can
drag and drop into the richtext editor.

All data is stored in a simple yet powerful SQLite database which provides you
with immediate access to your stored snippets.

Create new folders and documents. You can drag and drop one or multiple files
into the treeview to create them as snippets in SnippetSource.

This will create a copy of each document and will duplicate the underlying
folder structure as wel.

Nodes can be moved freely by dragging them to another folder.

It uses the text editor module which was developed for my Notepas project, and
is based on the SynEdit components used by Lazarus for its source code editor.
This has the convenient side effect that the capabillities of the text editor
will increase as Lazarus evolves.

Since version 3 the possibility to execute script code was added. Snippets that
represent script code can directly be executed.

My intention is to keep the user interface as clean and fast as possible so
users can focus more on the content rather than confront them with an
overwhelming and bloated user interface.

Use Cases
As I developer I use it for storing SQL-scripts, code snippets and short
tutorials with solutions for common problems.

A writer could use it to store his/her favourite quotes.

The source to your snippets of your sources

The abillity to execute scripts was added.

Images can be dragged and dropped into both the treeviewer and the Richeditor.

IDEAS:
- support for multiple databases as tabbed views
- drag and drop of nodes between seperate instances of snippetsource

TODO (22/12/2020)
- Multiselected drag/drop of folders/files does not insert to correct node
- Drag and drop of RTF documents
- Custom node sequence number (up/down position)
- More polished look for lookup form
- Bookmark positions or favourites which can be selected immediately
- Most recently changed nodes?
- Most visited nodes?
- Read only mode (with multiple editor buffer views side by side)
- Operations on multiselection of nodes
- Backup/restore option (7z)
- ImageIndex is now a reference to the internal imagelist rather than a
  reference to a record in the Glyph table.
- Customize the node images from a user definable set of glyphs which can be
  stored in the snippet database.

16/01/2021
- Added support for dragging and dropping URL's into the rich-text editor. This
  does work with Chrome and Edge and Firefox. If you cannot drag and drop links
  from Firefox, you can fix this by starting the application as follows with the
  '-no-deelevate' parameter: firefox.exe -no-deelevate

13/01/2021
- Version 3.1
- Cleanup settings dialog
- Added missing highlighters in Highlighter table.
- Simple database backup function added to settings dialog.
- Added query dialog (SHIFT+CTRL+Q), that can be used get direct access to the
  SQLite database.

- Do not loose position in tree after refresh.
- Store last size + position.

30/12/2020
- Image files (all types supported by TPicture) can be dragged and dropped into
  the treeviewer and the rich editor. Image file types other than png and jpg
  are automatically converted to jpg.
- Added settings to automatically hide text and rich-text editors based on node
  content.
- Delayed loading of RTF data makes the application more responsive now.

24/12/2020

- Refactored the datamodule with the data access components.
- SQLite (v.3.20.1) supports now varchar fields and these are now used for small
  text fields instead of the TEXT type, which translates to ftMemo in the
  sqldb components which prevents them to be used as lookup fields.
