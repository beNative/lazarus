#summary An overview of the main interfaces

= Introduction =

The main architecture of Notepas relies heavily on interfaces to achieve loose coupling between the key modules.

All the interfaces are declared in the {{{ts.Editor.Interfaces}}} unit. Instances of the key modules supporting those interfaces are created using factories, to reduce dependencies.

To use the editor library in an application you only need to use 2 units:

  * {{{ts.Editor.Interfaces}}} with all the interface types 
  * {{{ts.Editor.Factories}}} to create the required instances of those interface types.
